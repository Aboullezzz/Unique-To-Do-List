Task Completion and Circumstances
I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing to inform you about an issue I encountered before the task deadline. About a month prior to the task, I faced a problem with my MacBook and had to sell it. Despite this challenge, I managed to borrow a MacBook from a friend and completed the application within the five days as required.
I kindly ask you to consider that if I had my own MacBook, I would have been able to write even cleaner code and utilize advanced techniques such as protocols more effectively. Unfortunately, due to the lack of my own MacBook, I was constrained by time.
Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
Best regards,
Mohamed Aboullezz
